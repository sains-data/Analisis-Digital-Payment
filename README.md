# üíµ **ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL PAYMENT ADOPTION THROUGH THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS IN THE SUMATRA REGION**

This project aims to analyze the adoption of digital payment systems in the Sumatra region, specifically through the number of merchants using services such as QRIS, e-wallets, and cards. Using a Hadoop-based Big Data ecosystem, data from Bank Indonesia is processed in a structured manner through the Medallion architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold) to understand trends and factors that influence adoption, such as digital infrastructure and population density. Technologies such as Apache Spark, Hive, and Airflow are used for data processing, analysis, and visualization, so that the end result can be used as a basis for policy recommendations to encourage equitable adoption of digital payments in Sumatra.

## üìö **Project Overview**
This project includes:
- Batch Pipeline: Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold) for historical digital payment data.
- Analytical Modeling: Trend analysis & regional adoption patterns using Apache Spark & Hive.
- Data Integration: Combining national and regional e-money datasets from Bank Indonesia.
- Visualization & Reporting: Interactive dashboard via Apache Superset for policy decision-making.
- ETL & Orchestration: Automated data pipeline using Apache Airflow for scheduled updates.

üóùÔ∏è Key Focus Areas:
- Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- Apache Spark (ETL, Aggregation, Interpolation)
- Apache Hive (SQL analytics, OLAP)
- Apache Airflow & Ambari (Monitoring & Orchestration)
- Apache Superset (Dashboard & Reporting)
- Data Modeling with CSV & Parquet for scalable analytics
